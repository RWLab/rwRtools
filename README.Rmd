The goal of rwRtools is to make it easy to access The Lab's datasets and get started with research. 

## Installation

You can install rwRtools from GitHub like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("RWLab/rwRtools", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Demo

Authorise a Google Identity to access The Lab's cloud infrastructure by doing:

```{r auth example, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

```

You will be prompted to select a Google Identity in a browser and the copy and paste an authentication code back at the call site.
